freqalert 0.1.0 - MrDave

freqalert is a very simple program to detect a particular frequency and if it is
detected, execute a external command.  To make the program the following libraries
are needed (based upon current apt repo).

sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libfftw3-dev libsndfile1-dev

After the packages are installed, type 

make

Once freqalert is built, type 

freqalert -i

to display the devices on the computer and then adjust the freqalert.conf
file to specify the desired device and its associated parameters.  

NOTE:  This program is very rough.  It seems functional but may include significant
flaws that I will continue to investigate and resolve as I learn more about sound
processing.
